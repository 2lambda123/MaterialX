# OSL Source

The Open Shading Language team currently maintains source file generators for the MaterialX standard nodes at https://github.com/amartinez-cg/OpenShadingLanguage/tree/materialx/src/shaders/MaterialX, and the resulting OSL source files will be integrated into the MaterialX repository in the future.
